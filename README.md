### World Happiness Analysis

In this project, we explored the following topics:
* Which countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness, which is based on six factors contributing to happiness. 
* How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports
* Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?

We analyzed the data set in detail and visualize in with a wide range of visualization tools, in terms of regions, time and factors sequentially.
